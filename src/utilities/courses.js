Data Structures is about rendering data elements in terms of some relationship, for better organization and storage.An algorithm is a finite set of instructions or logic, written in order toaccomplish a certain predefined task. Algorithm is not the complete codeor program, it is just the core logic(solution) of a problem, which can beexpressed either as an informal high-level description as pseudocode orusing a flowchart.",
