      "The coronavirus pandemic has caused serious panic all over the world by infecting about 4 million worldwide and taking more than 200 thousand lives. The entire world is seeking a way to stop it. As AI technology evolves daily. Appearing in smart cars, IOT devices, banking, healthcare, and logistics.one is left to wonder what role this sort of technology plays in fighting this disease. Can it help make a difference? It can help and has been helping all along. AI systems all over the world have been used against the Covid-19 outbreak.First up is BlueDot an artificial intelligence platform that uses AI processing to analyze information and track over a hundred infectious diseases. The idea behind it was to “Spread knowledge faster than the diseases spread themselves,” says Kamran Khan, founder, and CEO of BlueDot.On Dec, it flagged an unusual pneumonia cluster happening in a market in Wuhan, China. The next day BlueDot issued a warning to its Customers to avoid Wuhan. This was nine days ahead of both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) who didn’t alert the public until January 2020. BlueDot also predicted where other outbreaks could be by analyzing traveler itineraries and flight paths. The system succeeded in carrying out its creator’s vision and saving who knows how many lives.Next, we have Insilco Medicine‘s AI technology for drug discovery in Hong Kong, the company was able to identify thousands of molecules for potential medications in just four days. It also started an open policy by making all its research and findings available for download for free on its website; an action that allowed a global-wide contribution to fighting the disease. They were able to narrow down the potential medications to seven possible molecules. They intended to make and test these molecules, but their plan was delayed as Over 20 of their contract chemists were quarantined in Wuhan.However, they managed to synthesize two of the seven molecules, and they plan to put them to the test in the nearby future. Insilico is also actively looking into drugs for improving the immune system of the elderly—so an older individual may respond to the infection as a younger person does, with milder symptoms and faster recovery. In addition to drugs that help restore lung function after infection.Furthermore, the SRI International research center headquartered in California, and AI company Iktos in Paris announced their collaboration in March. Using Iktos’ generative deep learning modeling technology combined with SRI’s SynFini, a fully automated end-to-end synthetic chemistry system, to design compounds and accelerate the identification of drug candidates to treat multiple viruses, including influenza and the coronavirus. They hope the collaboration can make a difference and speed up the identification of promising new therapeutic options for the treatment of COVID-19.Moreover, there is Benevolent AI, a leading British company in the application of AI and machine learning in the discovery and development of medications. It launched an operation back in February using its platform for drug discoveries to identify an approved drug that could potentially stop the disease’s progression their results lead to proposing baricite, an already approved drug developed by Eli Lilly originally for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, as a potential treatment with both anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties, for COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital prior to the development of critical lung damage.In April 2020, Benevolent revealed that the potential drug will be entering late-stage phase 3 clinical trials to treat the disease. Later on, trials will also be held in the US.On the other hand, China was able to weaponize its AI systems in the fight against the pandemic by associating AI with control over the spread by using robots for diagnostic checks. Saving the lives of hospital staff and avoiding risks.Additionally, the Chinese government used AI-controlled drones to supervise the curfew and safety processions on the streets. Along with creating an app that allows the user to check if they have been on a flight or a train with a confirmed coronavirus case. Plus, In the Hangzhou city ambulances are provided with AI systems to speed through traffic.Thanks to AI many contributions have been made to the current situation. Researchers all over the world are working to better utilize AI technology so that, one day soon one of these systems will come through and be our way to survive this disease and any further future outbreaks."),

      "The hardest thing about driving is parking. For many drivers, especially the beginners, the size of the parking spot isn't big enough for the vehicle. Minimizing the vehicle's size can't be the best solutions for all car types, but Mercedes-Benz has found the solution for this by providing smart cars and vehicles with an auto parking feature.Smart cars have a long history began when the maker of swatch - a famous brand of watches in the nineteenth - thought about apply the idea of his watches to develop in the automotive industry. He cooperated with Daimler-Benz AG, the makers of Mercedes-Benz to share his development of the new city car. The smart car called then (Smart Fortwo Electric Drive) because of its design of the two-door car.The powerful features like the design, the affordable cost, and technology of this type of cars have captured people’s minds.The design is a fusion between urban and modern design. Also, the interior is surprisingly spacious although it has only two doors. So it is the best choice for people who like small and stylish cars. Now smart cars service the future vision of the style of the smart modern cities."),

      "Machine learning lets machines learn by experience and acquire skills without human involvement. But how exactly is this happening?First let’s ask a question, what happens exactly when you try a new thing for the first time?The first time is a disaster, you should probably go and watch more examples for the thing you try to learn.The second time is still a disaster, repeat again and by the third time, things seem to get better.But after a whole year of watching, learning and practising, you become a master.Fortunately, machines now take a similar approach in life, you feed the machine with a bunch of data and ask them to make a decision.The first time is also a disaster, but with feedback and enough number of iterations, it gains enough experience to make a better decision.The only difference here is that machines don’t need one year of learning to master things; in most cases, half an hour is enough.And that’s exactly what describes the power of Machine Learning.That Power which helped this wonderful field to grow exponentially in the past 10 years and becomes the dream of our future"),

The origin of the story was when Steve Jobs visited Xerox PARC, he was surprised by the GUI, mouse and some other technologies.The problem was that the founders didn’t understand that they had an invention that would make them number one in the computer industry; however, they gave it to Steve to do something useful out of it. Steve Jobs took this invention and made small changes with GUI and made the Macintosh the first PC.We learn from Steve Jobs to take every single chance and to make no excuses, As Xerox PARC try to use your resources before giving up them."),
